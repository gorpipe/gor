Using GOR in Notebooks
======================
GOR can be combined with Python, R or SPARK through Jupyter notebooks using our relevant SDKs.
This allows the user to efficiently query genomic data while reading desired information into data frames opening the door to the advanced plotting and analysis tools of R or Python.

To create a new notebook select the **Notebooks** options from the current platform. You will be taken to a jupyter hub server page where you can create a new notebook from scratch or copy one of the built-in template notebooks from the GOR/ folder to your user directory.

Notebook Examples
=================

Below are examples of notebooks showcasing GOR query analysis.
